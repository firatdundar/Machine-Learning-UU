Introduction to Machine Learning Course - Uppsala University

- This is a practical introduction to machine learning: its terminology, an overview of basic supervised and unsupervised methods (for example, regression, classification, decision trees, clustering), use of established tools for machine learning, application of the methods to real data, and practical aspects such as dimensionality reduction and cross validation.

- This GitHub repository is dedicated to showcasing my work on homework assignments and project for this course.
